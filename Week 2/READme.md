*********************************************WEEK 2********************************************

**Code**
The half adder code has been created with verilog language. The half adder created using data flow abstraction
Here assign keyword used to store the xor and and operation result in sum and carry

**Test Bench**
Here different combination of value assigned to each input A and B
A and B are designated as register and sum and carry as wires
then time duration is mentioned

**Timing diagram**
The timing diagram of different combination are used

**Elaborated Design**
The code will be displayed as diagram

**Outcome**
By week2 task half adder has been designed and some of the operator has been learnt
Difference between data flow and behavioural model is learnt and how to code and 
draw graph for a program is learnt
